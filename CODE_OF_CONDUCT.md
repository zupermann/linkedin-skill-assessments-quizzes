## Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, wholeheartedly commit to fostering a harassment-free and inclusive environment in our community. We are dedicated to ensuring that every participant is treated with respect and dignity, irrespective of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to consistently engage with one another in a manner that promotes an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

We uphold a set of standards that contribute to a positive and collaborative atmosphere within our community. These standards encompass:

**1. Demonstrating Empathy and Kindness**

We encourage our members to approach interactions with empathy and kindness. Being sensitive to others' feelings and experiences is fundamental in building a supportive and inclusive environment.

**2. Respect for Diverse Opinions**

Our community thrives on the diversity of thought and perspective. We value and respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences, promoting healthy and constructive discussions.

**3. Accepting and Giving Constructive Feedback**

We believe in the importance of giving and receiving feedback graciously. Constructive feedback is an opportunity for growth. We encourage you to accept responsibility for your actions and apologize to those affected by your mistakes, using these experiences as a chance for personal development.

**4. Collective Well-being**

We advocate for a community that focuses not only on individual benefits but also on what is best for the overall community. We prioritize the common good and cooperation in all our endeavors.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, we consider the following behaviors unacceptable:

**1. Sexualized Language or Imagery**

The use of sexualized language or imagery, as well as any form of sexual attention or advances, is strictly prohibited within our community.

**2. Trolling, Insults, and Personal Attacks**

Trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, and engaging in personal or political attacks are not in line with our values. We foster respectful and constructive discussions.

**3. Harassment**

Harassment in any form, whether public or private, is not tolerated. Every member should be able to participate without fear of harassment.

**4. Privacy Violation**

Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission, is a breach of trust and privacy. Such actions are strictly prohibited.

**5. Inappropriate Conduct**

Any behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting has no place in our community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders play a crucial role in upholding our standards and maintaining the well-being of our community. Their responsibilities include:

- **Clarification:** Community leaders are responsible for clarifying our standards of acceptable behavior. They must ensure that all members understand what is expected of them.

- **Enforcement:** They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

- **Content Management:** Community leaders have the right and responsibility to manage contributions, including comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They will always communicate their reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, both online and offline. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official email address.
- Posting via an official social media account.
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be handled as follows:

- **Review:** All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We take all reports seriously.

- **Privacy:** All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Your confidentiality is our priority.
