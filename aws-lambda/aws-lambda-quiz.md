- [ ] Kinesis, S3, and SQS
- [ ] Kinesis, S3, and SNS
- [ ] Kinesis, DynamoDB, and SNS
- [x] Kinesis, DynamoDB, and SQS

**Explanation**

- `Lambda can used for all services mentioned on the question: Kinesis, S3, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB. But as you can see in the reference, Lambda's responsibility and method invocation can be categorized by Lambda polling and Event Driven (synchronous invocation). When you implement an event-driven architecture, you grant the event-generating service permission to invoke your function in the function's resource-based policy. Then you configure that service to generate events that invoke your function. When you implement a Lambda polling architecture, you grant Lambda permission to access the other service in the function's execution role. Lambda reads data from the other service, creates an event, and invokes your function. According to this analytics, Kinesis-DynamoDB-SQS use same method invocation, Lambda polling.`

#### Q51. Via what can a Lambda be called?

- [x] all of these answers
- [ ] a DynamoDB trigger
- [ ] an API Gateway
- [ ] an S3 bucket event

**Explanation** (source google)

- `With DynamoDB Streams, you can trigger a Lambda function to perform additional work each time a DynamoDB table is updated. Lambda reads records from the stream and invokes your function synchronously with an event that contains stream records.`
- `These events are considered synchronous events. Simply put, it means that when somebody is calling an API Gateway, it will trigger your Lambda function. It's a synchronous event because your Lambda function has to respond to the client directly at the end of its invocation.`
- `You can use Lambda to process event notifications from Amazon Simple Storage Service. Amazon S3 can send an event to a Lambda function when an object is created or deleted.`

#### 52. which is use case of lambda ?

#### Q57. A developer has created a Lambda function to scrub real-time data of extraneous information and then send the scrubbed data to Kinesis for further processing and storage. Some of the data showing up in Kinesis seems to be inaccurate. What's the best way for the developer to debug this?

#### Q62. A company will be modernizing their application which is currently running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances. They have experience with scaling this infrastructure using Amazon EC2 Autoscaling. They want to move to serverless infrastructure consisting of an Amazon API Gateway that triggers Lambda functions. They are consulting you about scaling this new infrastructure. What should the company consider in order to make sure the serverless infrastructure scales to their needs?

- [ ] Enable Auto Scaling Groups for AWS Lambda to ensure that enough Lambda functions are ready to handle the incoming requests
- [ ] Throttle Lambda functions by configuring reserved concurrency, sending the excess traffic to Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) that will be handled when the request volume reduces.
- [x] Look at service limits for Amazon API Gateway and Lambda functions used in order to identify potential bottlenecks and balance performance requirements, costs, and business impact
- [ ] Do nothing. API Gateway and AWS Lambda are managed services that have built-in horizontal scaling, security, and high availability to handle unlimited amount of requests

**Explanation**

- `In serverless it is important to understand the service limits of all the services used end to end to understand the level of requests that can be handled.`

- [x] You are charged for each Lambda invocation and the duration of execution time.
- [ ] You are charged based on the memory allocated to the function, irrespective of invocation.
- [ ] You are charged a flat monthly fee for using Lambda.

**Explanation**

- AWS Lambda charges are based on the number of requests (invocations) and the duration of time the code runs. Lambda pricing is based on the total number of requests and the time your code runs (in increments of 1 millisecond) from the start of the function until it returns or otherwise terminates. The duration is rounded up to the nearest 1ms.

#### Q77. What is the maximum execution timeout for an AWS Lambda function?

- [ ] 5 minutes
- [x] 15 minutes
- [ ] 60 minutes
- [ ] 10 minutes

**Explanation**

- AWS Lambda allows a maximum execution timeout of 15 minutes for a single invocation. After 15 minutes, the function will be automatically terminated, even if the function's process is still running. This is useful for long-running tasks but imposes a limit to ensure scalability and efficiency.

#### Q78. Which of the following triggers can NOT directly invoke a Lambda function?

- [ ] Amazon S3
- [x] Amazon RDS
- [ ] Amazon DynamoDB Streams
- [ ] Amazon API Gateway

**Explanation**

- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) cannot directly trigger a Lambda function. RDS is a managed database service and does not have built-in functionality to trigger Lambda directly. However, other services like S3, DynamoDB Streams, and API Gateway can trigger Lambda functions when specific events occur (e.g., file uploads, data changes, API calls).

#### Q79. You work for a company that has an AWS cloud deployment utilizing Lambda functions for various tasks. You need to select the appropriate resource types and sizes for these tasks. How should you optimize the amount of memory configured for Lambda functions on your AWS cloud?

- [ ] Use CloudTrail to track all API calls made on the system.
- [x] Use CloudWatch to monitor memory-bound functions.
- [ ] Utilize CloudFront for caching data for end users.
- [ ] Create a new VPC with an AWS Batch computing environment in it.

**Explanation**

- `You would use CloudWatch to monitor memory-bound functions and create an alarm when memory consumption nears a preset limit. This will help you find out when memory consumption reaches close to the preset maximum value so that you can avoid processing bottlenecks by increasing the configured memory for the functions. AWS CloudWatch allows you to monitor the AWS system in real time by monitoring and tracking resource metrics.`

#### Q80. You are running a photo-sharing website using various AWS services. You have an AWS Lambda function that performs image resizing and cropping whenever a user uploads a picture to an S3 bucket. You need to find a way to allow other AWS accounts and services to invoke this function when necessary. What would you do to implement this functionality?

- [ ] Use an identity-based policy to grant the needed permissions.
- [x] Use a resource-based policy to grant the needed permissions.
- [ ] Create an IAM user group to allow access to resources.
- [ ] Set the permissions for the S3 bucket to public.

**Explanation**

- `You would use a resource-based policy to grant the needed permissions. A resource-based policy is attached to an AWS resource such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, a virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption keys, and Amazon Simple Queueing Service (SQS) queues. Using a resource-based policy, you specify the principal who can access the resource and their permissible actions on the resource. A principal can be an account, user, role, or session principal. Session principals can be IAM federated users or role sessions. Policies are AWS objects that specify the permissions of an identity or a resource. You can choose an identity-based or resource-based policy when you create a permissions policy for restricted access to resources.`
